    <h2>I have listened to Reverend Todd.  I have seen the ATMs in the sanctuaries.  I have seen the churches converted to gymnasiums and discotheques and police stations and museums.  You cannot have a faith that can be so easily converted to so many things.  This is the essence of Christianity.  It is like capitalism.  It is like the chameleon, and, therefore, the American was like a chameleon.  Whatever shape or color he needed for a given situation he assumed.  This is why so many great actors and actresses come from here—this tendency.  One must be experienced in his craft in order to juggle the identity of the chameleon with the true identity of the believer.</h2>

  <h1>Biography</h1>

<p>I’m interested in the extremes of American life.   As a writer, I think it’s important to experience those extremes in order to write about them effectively.  I admire authors like Ernest Hemingway, Chris Hedges, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, William Vollman, and Ken Kesey, men who have risked their lives and sanity in order to bring us a greater awareness of the world.  I think good writing is worth that risk.</p>

<p>Freud writes:  “The meaning of the evolution of civilization is no longer obscure to us.  It must present the struggle between Eros and Death, between the instinct of life and the instinct of destruction, as it works itself out in the human species.  This struggle is what all life essentially consists of.”</p>

<p>Is Freud’s certitude suspect, perhaps the result of a coke-fueled ego?  Perhaps.  But I buy the thrust of his thesis.  Warriors and hippies have always interested me because they reveal, in their excesses, the irony of civilization, how we kill in the name of love, how we destroy our minds and bodies so we might feel closer to a communal truth.  War and peace, love and death, Eros and Thanatos—these are the dueling forces that send me to Iraq on the one hand, and into the strange arms of a Grateful Dead tribute band on the other.  When I was getting my media ID in Baghdad, a few of the soldiers chuckled as the printer popped it out.</p>

<p>“What?” I said.</p>

<p>“You’re the only journalist we’ve ever seen who smiled for his photograph.”</p>

<p>Does that make me a fool?  Perhaps.  Do I sometimes enjoy playing the fool?  I do.  There’s no place in the world too dark for a smile.</p>
