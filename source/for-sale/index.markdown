### "Hesca." [The Esquire Four](http://www.amazon.com/The-Esquire-Four-Fiction-ebook/dp/B00AFGVJBI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356040077&sr=8-1&keywords=the+esquire+four)
It’s always more thrilling to discover a new voice than to trot out an old, established one.

With "The Esquire Four," a collection of never-before-published short stories by new writers, Esquire, in collaboration with Byliner, presents its first e-book of new voices. Original stories by young writers are nothing new for the magazine, which championed the early careers of J. D. Salinger and Philip Roth and Raymond Carver and Cormac McCarthy. But this is Esquire’s first e-book of fiction by young writers, and the stories within are as portable as they come. And also as classic as any Esquire fiction.

In “Hesca,” M. C. Armstrong gives us a veteran back from Iraq, but it’s a war story unlike any other. It’s about organic gardening and Wiccans and Allen Ginsberg and dogs, and it has more humor than any story about PTSD ever should.

### "A Skeleton Key to The Grateful Dead in the Music of Ryan Adams." [Reading The Grateful Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Grateful-Dead-Critical-Survey/dp/0810883716/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1356040454&sr=1-1&keywords=reading+the+grateful+dead)
Since the 1960s, the Grateful Dead have welcomed and participated in academic work on the band, encouraging scrutiny from a wide variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives, from anthropology to sociology. Interest in Dead studies is growing across the country and around the world, and UC–Santa Cruz’s Grateful Dead Archive continues to attract a high level of attention.

In _Reading the Grateful Dead: A Critical Survey_, Nicholas G. Meriwether has assembled essays that examine the development of Grateful Dead studies. This volume features work from three generations of scholars, including a wide variety of perspectives on the band and its cultural significance. From insiders like lyricist John Perry Barlow and longtime band publicist and historian Dennis McNally to well-known Deadhead scholars such as Barry Barnes and Rebecca Adams, the contributors to this volume offer valuable insights into the Grateful Dead phenomenon.

No other Dead book focuses on the growth and development of the discourse, contains such a range of critical approaches, nor features work by luminaries Stan Krippner and Barnes, among others. The four sections of the book describe aspects and approaches to Dead studies, along with overviews of how the discipline evolved and what it comprises today. This collection will appeal to scholars, students, and teachers interested in Dead studies and fans of the band
