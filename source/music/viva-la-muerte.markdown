Viva la Muerte was born in 2005 when I traded tunes with a new friend in a Greensboro rooming house late one night.  The band evolved over the next two years.  A fiddler named Beady stepped in.  Enter a drummer named Big Daddy, a bass player named Newt.  Then comes the first death of Viva la Muerte as the original brothers parted ways within months of completing their first demo.

But the VLM songs stayed alive, some of them carrying over into Jacqui and the Woodsides ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Bh809_zNo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Bh809_zNo)), a project I was involved with in 2008-2009.  After two years as lead guitarist for Brother Esau ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3xJ6yOHB18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3xJ6yOHB18)), a Grateful  Dead tribute band, I returned to my original material in 2012 and found a new cast of characters to call Viva la Muerte.

In the fall of 2012, we completed a kickstarter campaign to fund our first album:

"All the Birds" will be available on iTunes and amazon.com by the summer of 2013.

And there’s a quote about the Samurai that I sometimes refer to when people ask what’s up with the name, Viva la Muerte:

> "The Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai.”

This is the essence of Viva la Muerte.  We are reminded to live by death.  Our ghosts compel us to create art, to bring the dead to life.  You can't have one (life) without the other (death).
