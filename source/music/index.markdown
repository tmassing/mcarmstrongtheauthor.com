### [Viva la Muerte](music/viva-la-muerte.html)
Viva la Muerte was born in 2005 when I traded tunes with a new friend in a Greensboro rooming house late one night. The band evolved over the next two years. A fiddler named Beady stepped in. Enter a drummer named Big Daddy, a bass player named Newt. Then comes the first death of Viva la Muerte as the original brothers parted ways within months of completing their first demo.
