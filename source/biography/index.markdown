I’m interested in the extremes of American life.   As a writer, I think it’s important to experience those extremes in order to write about them effectively.  I admire authors like Ernest Hemingway, Chris Hedges, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, William Vollman, and Ken Kesey, men who have risked their lives and sanity in order to bring us a greater awareness of the world.  I think good writing is worth that risk.

Freud writes:  “The meaning of the evolution of civilization is no longer obscure to us.  It must present the struggle between Eros and Death, between the instinct of life and the instinct of destruction, as it works itself out in the human species.  This struggle is what all life essentially consists of.”

Is Freud’s certitude suspect, perhaps the result of a coke-fueled ego?  Perhaps.  But I buy the thrust of his thesis.  Warriors and hippies have always interested me because they reveal, in their excesses, the irony of civilization, how we kill in the name of love, how we destroy our minds and bodies so we might feel closer to a communal truth.  War and peace, love and death, Eros and Thanatos—these are the dueling forces that send me to Iraq on the one hand, and into the strange arms of a Grateful Dead tribute band on the other.  When I was getting my media ID in Baghdad, a few of the soldiers chuckled as the printer popped it out.

“What?” I said.

“You’re the only journalist we’ve ever seen who smiled for his photograph.”

Does that make me a fool?  Perhaps.  Do I sometimes enjoy playing the fool?  I do.  There’s no place in the world too dark for a smile.

I come from comic roots.  One of my ancestors, Archibald, was a jester in the court of King James VI.

My parents nearly aborted me.  My mother was several months along with yours truly when she received a paralyzing case of food poisoning thanks to a bad piece of red snapper.  Luckily (for me), I lived, and was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on August 4th, 1977.  Yes, I share a birthday with our President.  We’re both Leos—a couple of strong-willed men who know how to detach, for good and ill.

My parents moved our family to the Shenandoah Valley when I was still a baby, and that’s where I grew up—Winchester, Virginia.  Winchester’s the birthplace of Patsy Cline, and back in the day, Patsy’s mother was a babysitter of mine.  Patsy wasn’t exactly loved while she was alive, but she’s the rose of the town now, which seems to be the way it always goes with artists…

I loved growing up in Winchester, the regal absurdity of our annual Apple Blossom Festival, the increasingly strange phenomenon of celebrating the blooming of orchards that no longer exist.  Winchester’s a fascinating place.  We’re ten minutes from the West Virginia border on the one hand, and about an hour from DC on the other, the young men who grow up in Funchester often a cross between the redneck and the metro-sexual, many of us a bit schizo as we try to negotiate modern life with a love for both the wilderness and the city, order and chaos.

After leaving Winchester for school, I was lucky enough to study fiction under George Garrett at UVA and Fred Chappell at UNCG.  The advice Garrett gave me when I asked what I needed to do to make it as a writer, is still the best advice I’ve ever heard on the subject:

“Last,” he said.  “Last.”
